# Vanilla native federation test

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

For the cross-angular test, run the ng19 workspace in another terminal

```bash
cd ng19
npm install
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
